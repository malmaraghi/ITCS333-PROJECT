Welcome to our ITCS333 Project Repository. This repository contains the work and progress of our group for the ITCS333 course. All code, documentation, and project materials related to the course will be organized here for easy access and collaboration.

## Project Overview

This repository serves as the central hub for managing our ITCS333 project, which focuses on developing a responsive web-based room booking system for the IT College. The system will incorporate various features to enhance both the user experience and administrative capabilities, including room browsing, booking management, user profiles, and an admin panel.

Key objectives of the project include:

- Enabling students and faculty to easily browse and book available rooms.
- Providing an intuitive user interface for managing bookings and user profiles.
- Giving administrators the ability to manage the system efficiently, with features like room management and user administration.
